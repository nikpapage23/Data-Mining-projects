## Project 1
We are using datasets corresponding to the electrical energy needs of the State of California and the sources from which they are met for each day of the year from 1/1/2019 through 12/31/2021 at a five-minute time resolution.
### Part A:
Performing graphic analysis of the data and extracting various conclusions.
### Part B:
Performing the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to find outlier-days in which demand or production didn't have the expected values.

## Project 2
Taking the "amazon.csv" dataset and creating a word vector for each review. Then, we're a using a RandomForest Classifier model to predict the rating corresponding to each review. Two approaches: multi-label classification with 5 labels and multi-label classification with 3 labels, describing the positivity of each review.

*The datasets for both projects can be found and downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRmxBu-U-2jlNnEk8e2ulpTaMYBOq6Mz/view?usp=sharing).*
